L
ist two examples of bad JavaScript code.
Minimize the use of global variables
Not minimizing unnecessary characters in a from source code can be seen as bad Javascript


Example 1
function validateForm(){
   if (verifyuserName()){
       if (verifyuserLastName()){
           if (verifyuserTelephone()){
               if (verifyuserEmail()){
                   return alert("the username and password is valid");
               }else return alert("FALSE this is an unusername and epost");
           }else return alert("FALSE this is an unusername and email");
       }else return alert("FALSE this is an unusername and email");
   }else return alert("FALSE this is an unusername and email");
Istead of: 
function validateForm(){
  if (verifyuserName() && verifyuserLastName() && verifyuserTelephone() &&  verifyuserEmail()){
   return (alert("its valid"));
  }
  else {
   return (alert("its invalid"));
  }
}


Let lol = [hey, hey, hye];
Let lol2 = [hey, hey, hye];
Let lol3 = [hey, hey, hye];
Let lol4 = [hey, hey, hye];

Function heya();{
}
